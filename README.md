## Overview

Dance Dance Labanotation is a VR training tool built for the Florida State University College of Dance. It helps dancers learn and practice Labanotation — a written notation system for choreography — through interactive spatial exercises in virtual reality.

The core challenge: Labanotation zones are spatial and body-relative, meaning the correct regions change size depending on the dancer's actual arm length. This required a dynamic, personalized approach rather than a fixed hitbox layout.

## My Contributions

- **Spatial hitbox system** — programmed a full array of Labanotation zone hitboxes in 3D space, mapped to body regions defined by the notation standard
- **Gemini Pro integration** — built an enterprise AI workflow that takes each dancer's arm length measurement as input and auto-generates a correctly-sized hitbox array, personalizing the experience per user
- **VR interaction design** — implemented the gesture recognition and feedback systems that tell dancers whether their movements hit the correct zones
- **Unity architecture** — structured the scene, scripts, and data flow across the full project

## Context

Developed in collaboration with the FSU College of Dance faculty as an experimental tool for movement education. Labanotation is one of the primary written systems for recording choreography — digitizing its learning process in VR is an active area of interest in dance pedagogy.
